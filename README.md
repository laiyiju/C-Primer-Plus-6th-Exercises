# C-Primer-Plus-6th-Exercises
Here are the solutions for programming exercises of Stephen Prata's [C Primer Plus 6th](https://books.google.co.jp/books/about/C++_Primer_Plus_6th_Edition.html?id=P7HuWSWtsh0C&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y).
I independently completed the programming exercises first and then consulted the solutions provided in the book, as well as the codes from [sgreenlee](https://github.com/sgreenlee/C-Primer-Plus-Exercises) and [yijfanzhu1592](https://github.com/yifanzhu1592/C-Primer-Plus-Programming-Exercises-And-Answers) for optimization.

As I haven't completed reading the book yet, the code updates will occur irregularly.
All exercise questions are included as comments at the beginning of each file, making it convenient to read the questions without having to switch between the book and the screen.
