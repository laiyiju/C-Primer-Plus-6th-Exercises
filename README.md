# C-Primer-Plus-6th-Exercises
Programming exercises of Stephen Prata's [C Primer Plus 6th](https://books.google.co.jp/books/about/C++_Primer_Plus_6th_Edition.html?id=P7HuWSWtsh0C&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y).
All the exercises were first solved by myself. And then When necessary, I referred to the solutions provided in the book, as well as the codes from [sgreenlee](https://github.com/sgreenlee/C-Primer-Plus-Exercises) and [yijfanzhu1592](https://github.com/yifanzhu1592/C-Primer-Plus-Programming-Exercises-And-Answers) to optimize my own codes.As I haven't finished reading the book yet, the code updates will be done irregularly.
